# -first-project
My first Python project after three weeks of learning.  Converts US dollars to euros using conditions, loops, and functions.  The user enters their total dollars (â‰¥$10), the amount to convert, and the exchange rate.  The program calculates euros and shows a receipt with transaction details.
